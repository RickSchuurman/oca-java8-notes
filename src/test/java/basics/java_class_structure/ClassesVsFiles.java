 * Most of the time, each Java class is defined in its own *.java file. It is usually public which means any code can call it. Java does not require that the class be public
 *
 * You can put two classes in the same file. One of the class is allowed to be public in this case.
 *
 * If you do have a public class, it needs to match the filename
