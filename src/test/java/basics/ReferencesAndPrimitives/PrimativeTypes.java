/*
 * Java has 8 build in primative types
 *
 * Float and Double are use for decimals
 *
 * Byte, short, int, long are use for numbers without decimal points
 *
 * Each nummeric type use twice as many bits as the smaller similar type. Short use twice as many bits as byte does
 *
 * a byte is 8 bits and each bit has two possible values ( 0 or 1) 2(8) 2 x 2 = 4 x 2 = 8 x 2 = 16 x 2 = 32 x 2 = 64 x 2 = 128 x 2 = 256
 *
 * the number of bits is used by Java wehn it figures out how much memory to reserve for your variable
 *
 * Numeric primitives: when a number is present in the code, it is called a literal
 *

//        long max = 3123456789; // DOES NOT COMPILE, compiler thinks it is an integer and max value integer is 2147483647
